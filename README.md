Great fundamentals built in the hackathon! 

# Now that we have more time:

- It would be great if we could start branching (from development) based on the features you are working on.

- We should also start using issues so that we arent all working on the same task in different ways.

- Please try to limit the use of AI-generated code, and if necessary, check and test it before pushing.
